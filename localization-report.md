# SugoSure Website Localization Report

## Task Completed: May 14, 2025

### Summary
The SugoSure website has been successfully downloaded and converted for local viewing. All necessary files are present and navigation links have been updated to point to local versions instead of the original domain.

### Steps Completed
1. Created and executed scripts to download the website from sugosure.com
2. Fixed navigation links throughout the site to ensure they work locally
3. Verified that all linked files exist and are accessible
4. Created backup scripts and testing tools for maintenance

### Files Structure
- Main website files are located in `/users/norvin/desktop/sugosure-website/www.sugosure.com/`
- The main entry point is `index.html`
- All section pages (like how-it-works, patient, physician, etc.) are present
- CDN resources have been properly downloaded and referenced

### Testing
- All navigation links in the index.html page have been tested and confirmed to work
- Internal section links (like from one article to another) should function properly
- External links to third-party sites remain unchanged
- All resource files (CSS, JS, images) should load properly when viewed offline

### Next Steps
1. Open `/users/norvin/desktop/sugosure-website/www.sugosure.com/index.html` in a browser to test overall functionality
2. Review the website to ensure all content is displayed correctly
3. Push the entire website folder to GitHub for setting up GitHub Pages hosting

### Maintenance Scripts
- `fix_local_links_macos.sh`: Script to fix any remaining URL references to the original domain
- `check_links.sh`: Script to verify that linked files exist in the local copy

If you encounter any issues with specific pages, you can use the provided scripts to fix them or manually edit the HTML files to correct specific problems.
